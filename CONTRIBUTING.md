# Contributing to ARMORY

Thank you for considering contributing to ARMory!

Writing low-level embedded systems code takes a lot of effort, so really - I
appreciate you even thinking about jumping in.

However, with that said, the contribution guidelines are a WIP, so make contributions
as you see fit, and open a pull request!
